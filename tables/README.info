This directory contains a set of the precomputed tables required to
perform FC-Gram periodic extensions. Currently the tables in this
directory span all the cases with matching values (O) from 3 to 9
and continuation points (C) from 10 to 50.

Note that a few extra tables (C=114,238,496, with O=7) which are
used to perform spectral interpolation betweeen frequent resolutions
are also provided.

If another combination of parameters is required, it can be generated
using the Fortran program available at:
https://github.com/mfontanaar/fctables.
